### Project Intro/Objective

This project aims to create an application for predicting pedestrian safety using machine learning and crime data. Murders have spiked nearly 40 percent since 2019, and violent crimes, including shootings and other assaults, have increased overall (Lopez, 2022). Every 26.3 seconds, someone suffers a violent attack in the United States (Protection1, n.d.). Violent crimes comprise four offenses, including murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault.

**Data Analysis, Visualization, and Modeling**  
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
