### Project Intro/Objective

This project examines pedestrian safety using machine learning and recent crime data. The goal is to automate a process to identify the safest route between locations, as well as provide additional up to date crime information. This project is looking for the “safest” route, which does not guarantee the route is safe. In some instances, there is no “safe” route. Additionally, where crime is concerned, often factors such as time of day and traits relating to the victim such as age, sex, race, are elements of safety. The solution discussed here not only identifies the safest route but includes elements of situational awareness to assist in making the best decision possible regarding personal safety. When it comes to navigating an area safely, recommendations can be made, but ultimately it is up to the navigator to determine what level of risk is acceptable.

### Data Acquisition and Aggregation

The data was downloaded from the Los Angeles Police Department and preprocessed initially using the ArcGIS ArcPy library. Each crime data point was spatially joined to street segments within 50 feet, producing a one-to-many relationship between streets and crimes. The resulting dataset contained merged street and crime data. The merged dataset was then joined to Los Angeles police districts to extract the district description to validate the LAPD crime data and add the district description to streets which did not have crimes associated with them. Once all three datasets were joined, all records with null street ID values were dropped and the dataset was exported to .csv for exploratory data analysis and further preprocessing.
