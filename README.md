## Project Objective

This project examines pedestrian safety using machine learning and recent crime data. The goal is to automate a process to identify the safest route between locations, as well as provide additional up to date crime information. This project identifies the “safest” route, which does not guarantee the route is safe. In some instances, there is no “safe” route. Additionally, factors such as time of day and personal traits like age, sex, and race are elements of safety. The solution discussed here not only identifies the safest route but includes elements of situational awareness to assist in making the best decision possible regarding personal safety. When it comes to navigating an area safely, recommendations can be made, but ultimately it is up to the navigator to determine what level of risk is acceptable.

## Project Overview
The project commences by downloading the data from LAPD and filtering out non-violent crime. The data is georeferenced and spatially joined to the Los Angeles street GIS dataset. It is then preprocessed and a flat .csv file is provided for further examination, preprocessing, and modeling. The final model output is then incorporated into a [web mapping application](https://chrisrobinson.maps.arcgis.com/apps/webappviewer/index.html?id=5b3684334cf14070b09650392eecd26b) which allows the end-user to create turn-by-turn directions avoiding dangerous streets.

> Whereas there are more males than females in this dataset, it can be seen from both the regular and normalized distributions, respectively, that more serious crimes occur with a higher prevalence (69,370 or 64.24%) for the former than the latter (28,565 or 41.70%). For sexes unknown, there is a 36.70% prevalence rate for more serious crimes.

> More serious crimes (35,396) occur in the morning than any other time of day. Evening crimes are generally more serious, but account for less crimes in total than those in the morning or afternoon. More serious night crimes account for only 9,814 (approximately 10%) of all such crimes. However, 60% of crimes occurring at night are more serious and crimes in the afternoon give no preference to severity, occurring at about equal rates.  


## Modeling & Model Evaluation
* Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* XGBoost

Determining the model for deployment involves a comprehensive inspection of all area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves. As you can see here, we have our introductory QDA model with an auc of 0.54, which is barely above the baseline. Logistic regression makes a 10% improvement to an AUC of 0.64, followed by the Decision Tree that adds another 14% to an AUC of 0.78, and performance keeps improving, especially with these more complex tree-based classifiers, where we now see the best performing model of XGB with an auc of 0.94. However, sensitivity and false alarm rates should also be considered as additional measures of performance assessment.

## Conclusion

During this project, some key considerations came to light regarding safely navigating potentially dangerous areas. Model outcomes alone would likely not be sufficient for ensuring safety with a significant degree of confidence. While historical crime data adds a layer of information, more information may be required to get a complete picture of safety in a particular area. There may be other factors associated with location and crime that contribute to safety. For example, lighting and the presence of other people are not currently considered but could be useful for evaluating safety. To avoid a potentially dangerous main street, an individual may decide to alter their course and travel along an adjacent side street. An argument could be made that the side street may be more dangerous than the main street because of unknown factors. The side street could also have less crime because it is traveled less often. It can be difficult to identify the main factors that contribute to safety because those factors may be different depending on location. Ultimately, there may not be a safe route, and the safest option is to avoid the area altogether. Routing applications, such as the one created for this project, are best suited for planning purposes so that individuals can identify safer pedestrian routes prior to traveling.
